  Nature does not know such a concept - philosophy.
  Philosophy is usually called the pitiful and ridiculous attempts made by people to understand Nature. 
  The results of such efforts also pass for philosophy.
  It’s the same as if the carrot root was trying to find the causes and consequences of its existence, calling the result of deliberation the eternal and mysterious conflict between the Root and the Top.
